export default `Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their powerful build and distinctive orange coat with black stripes. They are apex predators found primarily in Asia, inhabiting forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps.

There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, and Malayan tiger. Each subspecies is adapted to its unique environment, but all are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.

Tigers are solitary animals, usually hunting alone at night. Their diet mainly consists of large ungulates like deer and wild boar. A tigerâ€™s roar can be heard as far as 3 kilometers away, and it uses vocalizations, scent markings, and visual cues to communicate with others.

They are also strong swimmers and often cool off in streams, lakes, and ponds. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and are capable of swimming long distances.

Conservation efforts are ongoing globally to protect tiger habitats and curb illegal trade of tiger parts. Many organizations are working in collaboration with local governments and communities to ensure the survival of these majestic creatures.
